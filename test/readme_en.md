
# ðŸš€ Static Code Analysis Tool (vuln_analisis_tool)

This tool performs static code analysis using `cppcheck` to identify vulnerabilities in C/C++ projects.

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This Docker container runs a script that uses `cppcheck` to analyze the source code of the mounted project and generate a vulnerability report.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Docker installed on your system.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### 1. Build the Docker Image

First, build the Docker image with the following command:

```sh
docker build -t vuln_analisis_tool .

### 2. Run the Container

Make sure you are in the directory containing the source code you want to analyze. Then, run the container with:

docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/proyecto vuln_analisis_tool


### 3. Interaction

The script will prompt you for the project path inside the container (which should be /proyecto), and then generate a vulnerability report in the mounted directory.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

Ensure cppcheck is installed on your local machine if you want to use it outside the container.
The container will remove temporary files generated during the analysis upon completion.
